# Module 14 challenge - Bikesharing business analysis

## Overview of the statistical analysis
After discovering a bikesharing business in NY, we are being asked to analyze the available data. After completing this analysis, we will be able to understand the different metrics behind this business: customers, their habits, behaviors, and main locations.
After the analysis is complete, we should be able to determine if a similar business in Des Moines has a good chance of being successful. 

## Results
The visualizations we have built will be fundamental to explain our analysis. You can find the whole story here:

Let's analyze the story...

### Visualization 1 - Checkout times for users

![vis_01](/imgs/vis_01.png)

This graph is showing the duration for trips made by customers. We can see the peak of the graph is at 146k users, with a trip duration of five minutes. Generally speaking, we can observe the majority of trips are taking between 1 to 60 minutes.
From this, We can conclude most of the trips are of very short duration. This is telling us our users have well definied ending points.

### Visualization 2 - Checkout times by gender

This visualization is similar to visualization 1, but broken down by gender. The bahavior is basically the same, for all three data categories, most of the trips are taking five to ten minutes. Also, we can see that most of the trips are done by men, meaning that most of our customers are males.
