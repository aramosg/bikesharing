# Module 14 challenge - Bikesharing business analysis

## Overview of the statistical analysis
After discovering a bikesharing business in NY, we are being asked to analyze the available data. After completing this analysis, we will be able to understand the different metrics behind this business: customers, their habits, behaviors, and main locations.
After the analysis is complete, we should be able to determine if a similar business in Des Moines has a good chance of being successful. 

## Results
The visualizations we have built will be fundamental to explain our analysis. You can find the whole story here:

Let's analyze the story...

### Visualization 1 - Checkout times for users

![vis_01](/imgs/vis_01.png)

This graph is showing the duration for trips made by customers. We can see the peak of the graph is at 146k users, with a trip duration of five minutes. Generally speaking, we can observe the majority of trips are taking between 1 to 60 minutes.
From this, We can conclude most of the trips are of very short duration. This is telling us our users have well definied ending points.

### Visualization 2 - Checkout times by gender

![vis_02](/imgs/vis_02.png)

This visualization is similar to visualization 1, but broken down by gender. The bahavior is basically the same, for all three data categories, most of the trips are taking five to ten minutes. Also, we can see that most of the trips are done by men, meaning that most of our customers are males.

### Visualization 3 - Trips by weekday for each hour

![vis_03](/imgs/vis_03.png)

This visualization is helping us to understand how much trips are completed by hour. We can see a pattern here. From Monday to Friday, we can see mpst of the trips are done at the same times. From 7 to 9 am and from 5 to 7 pm. This are working hours. This means our customers are considering bike as mean of transportation. 
During the weekends, we can see a similar behavrior on Saturdays and Sundays. We have an evenly distrubution of trips from 10 am to 7 pm. Saturday is busiests than Sundays. We can conclude that our customers are also using bike as a mean of transportation during their weekend plans. 

### Visualization 4 - Trips by gender

![vis_04](/imgs/vis_04.png)

This is similar to visualization 3, but broken down by gender. This confirms our conclusions so far. Most of our customers are men. All our customers are traveling on well defined times from Monday to Friday (they are trying to reach their work places). On weekends, Saturday is a good day for the business. Busy hours are from 10 am to 7 pm.

### Visualization 5 - User trips by gender

![vis_05](/imgs/vis_05.png)

This one is similar to visualization 3 and 4, but it is segragating data by user type: "Customer" or "Subscriber". The "Customer" segment is showing a flat behavior. It is very hard to say what are the days with more activity. This is different for the "Subscriber" segment. Behavior between women and men is very similar. Thursday is the day with the highest activity. 

### Extra visualizations 6 and 7 - Starting and Ending points

 Top starting points

 Top ending points

![vis_07](/imgs/vis_07.png)

These visualizations are showing the top starting and ending points for all trips. Taking this as a starting point, we can start thinking why these stations are the most popular. Are they close to a train station? close to any other popular spots such as restaurants or any other entertainment centers? It grabs my attention that the top starting point and the top ending point are the same. 

### Extra visualization 8 - Customers age groups

![vis_08](/imgs/vis_08.png)

This visualization is showing the different age groups for all our customers. Our largest customer groups were born in the 80s and 90s. This is important to know the preferences of our customers. It is also important to know their priorities and the stage of their lives.
