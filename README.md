# Module 14 challenge - Bikesharing business analysis

## Overview of the statistical analysis
After discovering a bikesharing business in NY, we are being asked to analyze the available data. After completing this analysis, we will be able to understand the different metrics behind this business: customers, their habits, behaviors, and main locations.
After the analysis is complete, we should be able to determine if a similar business in Des Moines has a good chance of being successful. 

## Results
The visualizations we have built will be fundamental to explain our analysis. You can find the whole story here:
